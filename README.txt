CS 325 - Fall 2015


There are two files for the program. The only one you need to run is Project1-cs325.py

We hardcoded the file name MSS_Testproblems.txt to be taken as it was originally written, from the same directory as Project1-cs325.py.

It will run through all 4 algorithms using this file for each, and output the file  MSS_Results.txt to the same directory in the format of:

Algo1 Max Subarray:[8, 1, 3, 3, 1, -1, -4, -6, 2, 8, 19] Sum: 34

As long as you have MSS_Problems.txt in the same directory simply  run the file use run > python Project1.cs325.py
